<h2>Contents of $_SESSION:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">sessTag</span>:
a string of the format SESSION_NAME=SESSION_ID, for embedding in URLs.
(This is rarely used now; you use <span style="font-family: monospace;">makeEventURL()</span>
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">makeEventForm()</span>
instead.)<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">dataDir</span>:
the (absolute) directory on the server that all data for this user is
stored in.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">dataURL</span>:
the (relative) URL for accessing user data. (Only correct for scripts
in <span style="font-family: monospace;">public_html</span>, not its
subdirectories. This will work for delegates in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pages</span> because they appear to be
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">public_html/index.php</span>.)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">pages</span>:
a stack of information about delegate pages in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pages/</span>. This is the mechanism
for the call-and-return, model-view-controller UI architecture provided
by <span style="font-family: monospace;">index.php</span>. See <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">lib/event-page.php</span> for details.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">currEventID</span>:
also part of the MVC architecture. See <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">lib/event-page.php</span> for details.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">userIP</span>:
the probable IP number of the current user. Not 100% reliable.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">timeZone</span>:
a key into $TIME_ZONES (see timezones.php) for the user's preferred
time
zone.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">models</span>:
an array of model-information entries (which are themselves arrays), as
described below.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">lastUsedModelID</span>:
the ID of the last model used for any operation (may be null). Helps
provide defaults for the user as they work through the MolProbity flow.
This is usually used in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">display()</span>
method of <span style="font-family: monospace;">xxx_setup.php</span>
pages. The preferred place to set it is in the event handling methods
of those same pages, but it may sometimes be more appropriate to do
that from a background script.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">edmaps</span>:
an array of file names for electron density maps, which are stored in <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">dataDir/MP_DIR_EDMAPS</span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">archives</span>:
an array of file names for temporary archive files, which are stored in
    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">dataDir</span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">hetdict</span>:
the (absolute) path to a custom heterogen dictionary for Reduce. If
this is not set, the system default will be used instead.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">bgjob</span>:
an array for storing information about the currently running background
job. This can serve both as input and output to the background script.
The only field that must be defined is <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">isRunning</span>;
this will be set automatically before the job is launched, but the job
itself is responsible for clearing this flag just before it exits.
Failing to clear this will make it appear that the job never exited and
instead ran forever.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">kingSize</span>:
one of "tiny", "small", "default", or "large" - determines the size of
the KiNG window.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">moreOpts</span>:
an array of flags for showing more options in various forms, described
below.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Files present in the system data directory
($_SESSION[dataDir]/system):</h2>
You shouldn't ever be using the named files directly; instead, access
them
through the sessions and labbook APIs. Still, it's good to be aware
that they're here.<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">session</span>:
stores all the user session data.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">lifetime</span>:
timestamps for the last time this session was accessed. Used for
garbage collection.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">labbook</span>:
the serialized PHP data structure for all of the lab notebook entries.
Not (very) human readable.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">progress</span>:
the progress indicator for the background job. Controlled by <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">setProgress()</span>.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">errors</span>:
the output (stdout and stderr) from background jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Issues to be aware of when working with files</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Mac OS X filesystem (HFS) is case-<span
 style="font-style: italic;">preserving</span> but <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> case-<span
 style="font-style: italic;">sensitive</span>.
That means that files named "foo", "Foo", and "FOO" all refer to
exactly the same file, although the file system will list that file
with the capitalization you originally supplied. The PHP <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">file_exists()</span> function deals
with this correctly; i.e., if you <span style="font-family: monospace;">touch
foo</span> then <span style="font-family: monospace;">file_exists("Foo")
== true</span>.</li>
  <li>Users love to upload files with "weird" characters in their
names, especially spaces. See the <span style="font-family: monospace;">censorFileName()</span>
function in lib/core.php.</li>
  <li>Hackers would love to upload a file named <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">session</span> and overwrite your
session data, or to pass <span style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/passwd</span>
to a script that displays files. Remember that the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">apache</span> account -- which runs
PHP -- has pretty generous permissions on your server. Think security
first when dealing with the file system!</li>
  <li>Permissions of files created by PHP are controlled by the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">umask()</span> function; permissions
of directories are set at create time by <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">mkdir()</span>.
Uploaded files often have very restrictive permissions that are
retained when they are moved or copied. If you're not sure, use <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">chmod()</span> to be safe! (And note
that <span style="font-family: monospace;">chmod()</span> takes an
octal argument, so be sure to prefix the number with a zero: e.g.,
0644).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contents of $_SESSION['models']['<span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">myModelID</span>']:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">id</span>:
this is the key used for storing this model; labelled <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">myModelID</span>
above.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">prefix</span>:
a string to be prepended to file names for generated files. Usually
something like "1ubq-" but it could even be the empty string. Example
name: <span style="font-family: monospace;">$cbfile =
"{$prefix}cbeta.dat"</span>, assuming <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$prefix</span> has already been
assigned this value.
Curly braces ensure proper variable interpolation; see the PHP manual
for explanation.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">pdb</span>:
the filename for the PDB that is this current model. Full
path is <span style="font-family: monospace;">$_SESSION['dataDir']</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">."/".MP_DIR_MODELS."/".$_SESSION['models']['</span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; font-family: monospace;">myModelID</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">']['pdb']</span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">stats</span>:
the information returned by PdbStat for the PDB.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">segmap</span>:
the segID-to-chainID mapping string that was applied to this file
(relative to its parent), or not set if none. This is specifically <span
 style="font-style: italic;">not</span> a heritable property: one
remapping fixes the problem once and for all.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">parent</span>:
the model ID of the model this one is "derived" from. For instance, a
model representing the results of <span style="font-family: monospace;">reduce
-build</span> might point back to the file pulled directly from the
PDB. This key is not set for models supplied by the user.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">history</span>:
human-readable one-line statement about where this model came from.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">isReduced</span>:
true if the PDB file has been processed by Reduce, so we know at a
minimum that all hydrogens are present. This is a heritable property.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">isBuilt</span>:
true if the PDB is the result of a <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-build</span> and/or <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-fix</span> run in Reduce, so the
expert system has already changed all the Asn, Gln, and His that might
need changing. This is a heritable property.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Files created for each model:</h2>
All the actual file names are preceded by the model <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">prefix</span>.
Listed below are the suffixes. Order is alphabetical by file type, then
by file name. Not all files will necessarily be generated for every
model.<br>
<ul>
  <li>multi.chart</li>
  <li>multiall.chart<br>
  </li>
  <li>cbdev.data</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">clash.data</span>:

  <li>rota.data</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">aac</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">.kin</span>:
all-atom contacts combined in one kin, with separate groups for
mainchain vs.
sidechain<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">cb3d.kin</span>:
the standard Prekin 3-D rendering of C-beta deviations</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">cb2d.kin</span>:
the "bullseye" kinemage plot of C-beta deviations for the whole
structure at once</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">multi.kin</span>:
the "multi-criterion" kinemage with all validation data at once<br>
  </li>
  <li>rama.kin</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">sswing.kin</span>:
shows the results of running SSWING on a set of user-selected residues.
Similar to a flipkin.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">H.pdb</span>:
the result of a <span style="font-family: monospace;">reduce -build</span>
run on some other model. Asn/Gln/His are flipped according to the
judgement of the expert system.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">mp.pdb</span>:
the original uploaded/downloaded model file, as modified by <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">preparePDB()</span> (linefeeds, CNS
atom names, seg IDs).<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">nbH.pdb</span>:
the "nb" stands for "no build" - none of the existing atoms have been
moved, but missing hydrogens were added and optimized. Asn/Gln/His are
in their original orientations.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">Hfix.pdb</span>:
the result of a <span style="font-family: monospace;">reduce -build
-fix</span> run, where the user choose which Asn/Gln/His should be
flipped. This should be different in some way than the H.pdb file.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">S.pdb</span>:
the final SSWING PDB, which only includes user-approved changes.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">sswing.pdb</span>:
throw-away PDB generated by the initial SSWING run, before user review.</li>
  <li>rama.pdf<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2>Contents of $_SESSION['bgjob']:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">isRunning</span>:
this will be set automatically before the job is launched by <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">launchBackground()</span>, but the job
itself is responsible for clearing this flag just before it exits.
Failing to clear this will make it appear that the job never exited and
instead ran forever.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">processID</span>:
the Unix PID of the parent background process. Can be used to abort
background jobs if necessary. Cleared by <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">launchBackground()</span>.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">startTime</span>:
Unix timestamp of job start time. Set by <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">launchBackground()</span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">endTime</span>:
Unix timestamp of when the job finished. Must be set by the job itself.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">refreshRate</span>:
number of seconds between refreshes of the progress monitoring page.
Set by <span style="font-family: monospace;">launchBackground()</span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">whereNext</span>:
Name of the page to go to when job is finished, in the same form as
would be passed to <span style="font-family: monospace;">pageGoto()</span>.
The context will automatically be set to <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$_SESSION['bgjob']</span>. E.g. <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$_SESSION['bgjob']['whereNext'] =
"sitemap.php"</span>.</li>
  <li>... plus other entries specific to the particular job at hand.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Contents of $_SESSION['moreOpts']:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">all</span>:
true if we should always show extra options, regardless of any other
settings below. If set, links to show more/fewer options are also
supressed.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;"></span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">pdbUpload</span>:
