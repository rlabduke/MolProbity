MolProbity depends on special extensions to AWK which are only present in Gawk.
Mac OS X systems do not come with GNU Awk.
Thus, this directory contains precompiled binary of GNU Awk (gawk) v3.1.3.
It was compiled on a PowerBook G4 running OS X 10.3.1.

GNU Awk is free software available under the GPL.
See http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/gawk.html.
